When designing software I first create UML class diagrams and write pseudocode before I begin writing the code. In this class we were provided with OpenGL files and some code to work with so I actually only wrote pseudocode. I also took a photograph of objects that I wanted to create for my final project so I had a plan for the 3D objects that I wanted to depict in my final 3D Scene.

The tutorial files that were provided for this course were very useful and the code in the individual files was extremely well organized and helpful. The LearnOpenGL website, the Youtube videos and all the other resources that were provided in this course were also essential in helping me understand how to develop the code for the assignments in this course.
